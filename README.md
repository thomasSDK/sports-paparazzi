This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The API flow was based on the Wonderful folk at [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/add-beautiful-images-with-the-unsplash-api/) tested using Postman.

Trans browser Reflection effect was borrowed from [Red Stapler](https://www.notion.so/thomassdk/Realistic-Reflection-Effect-with-Pure-CSS-Red-Stapler-ab36837c47f14e8090ee613192d7e810)

Emoji's were made possible by the [Open Emoji API](https://css-tricks.com/add-beautiful-images-with-the-unsplash-api/)

And the idea of the falling objects was modelled after Dan Shiffmans excellent book [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/)

Fonts were sourced from [Font Space](https://www.fontspace.com/category/sports)

Last but not least the favicon was created by [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/)
